# Assembly-Calc_average
C function written in assembly to get the average of a set of numbers

This was a program I wrote a while back, but am uploading to GitHub for keepsake. It is suppose to run under a C program that calls
void calc_avg(int arr[], int size, int* ptr_result); but since its creation I have lost the C code that does so.
